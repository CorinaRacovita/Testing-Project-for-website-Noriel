### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria

The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.

## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

Implementing test monitoring and control for the Noriel website involves several key steps and best practices.

**To begin with, we defined the objectives and the scope**.

•	*Key metrics are identified*: key performance indicators for the site, such as load time, uptime, transaction success rate and user experience metrics.

•	*Goals are set*: clear goal for these metrics, such as a maximum page load time of 2 seconds, 99.9% uptime, etc.

•	*Scope is established*: decide which pages and functionalities require monitoring. These typically include the home page, product pages, checkout process, and user account pages.

**Set up automated tests**

•	*Functional Testing*: Writing test cases to verify the basic functionality of the website and ensuring that these tests cover all critical user interactions such as product navigation, adding items to cart, and completing checkout.

•	*Performance testing*: Load and stress tests are performed to understand how the site performs under different traffic levels.


**Analyze data and generate reports**

•	*Regular reports*: Daily, weekly or monthly reports summarizing key metrics and performance trends. These reports should highlight any issues, their impact and the actions taken to resolve them.

•	*Create dashboards*: Dashboards using tools like Grafana or Tableau to visualize performance metrics and trends over time. This helps to make quick decisions and identify areas that need improvement.

 **Control and improvement measures**

•	*Incident Management*: A process is established for incident management, including detection, diagnosis, resolution and post-incident review. We use this information to prevent future occurrences.

•	*Continuous improvement*: Testing and monitoring processes are regularly reviewed to identify areas for improvement. Update test cases, improve monitoring configurations, and optimize performance based on findings.

•	*Stakeholder Communication*: Maintains clear communication with stakeholders about site performance, issues and improvements. Reports and dashboards are used to provide transparency.


**Security and compliance**

•	*Security Testing*: Periodic security testing, such as vulnerability scans and penetration tests, is performed to identify and mitigate security risks.


**The feedback loop**

•	*User feedback*: We collect feedback from users through surveys, feedback forms or direct communication and use this feedback to improve the user experience and to address potential bottlenecks.

•	*Team Feedback*: Team members are encouraged to provide feedback on the monitoring and control processes and this input is used to refine and improve the approach.

 ![image](https://github.com/CorinaRacovita/Testing-Project-for-website-Noriel/assets/166423397/7a36768f-2179-43ef-8c27-5be41308b975)
   
   Figure 11 Traceability Matrix for project in JIRA
   
Following the feasibility matrix report, we found that within the project we have 5 stories (REC-2, REC-5, REC-8, REC-11, and REC-14. 

It can be seen in the image below that tests are linked to each created story.

We have linked to the REC-2 story only one test executed and passed successfully

We have linked to the REC-5 story a test which, after the execution, did not pass successfully and a bug was detected (REC-7)

We have linked a test executed and successfully passed to the REC-8 story

We have linked 3 successfully executed and passed tests to the REC-11 story

We have linked 4 executed tests to the REC-14 story, of which 3 passed successfully and one failed, a bug being detected (REC-19)


   **DASHBOARDS**

Following the execution of the test by the user, 80% of the tests pass successfully and 20% fail. 

After executing the cycle test, it can be seen that it is divided into two large categories: "Test product cart Noriel" and "Manage account" 

In the "Test product cart Noriel" cycle, 2 out of 3 tests passed, representing a percentage of 66.67% (passed tests) and 33.33% (failed tests). 

In the "Manage account" cycle, 6 out of 7 tests passed, representing a percentage of 85.71% (passed tests) and 14.29% (failed tests).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5074558d-7387-4168-be7a-0b873d628757)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25808317-0a7a-4d1d-8760-06eeb4e97e60)


A number of 2 total bugs were found, from which the priority are high .
The overall conclusion for the Noriel website test is that it aims to provide an optimal online shopping experience by ensuring that the website is functional, user-friendly and visually appealing. It should perform well in different conditions, provide comprehensive and accurate content, and maintain high security standards.
In addition, the 10 tests show that it should facilitate a smooth purchase process, provide efficient customer support and be accessible and visible to all users. Also, although the bugs found are of high importance, they do not prevent the launch of the application.
